# LSystems
Experiments with L-systems

I read a good bit of this pdf:
http://algorithmicbotany.org/papers/abop/abop-ch1.pdf

I was interested in making plant looking stuff but just never got there. Life caught up with me.
As I've been thinking about this and looking it over, and very much as a result of some classes I'm taking,
I'm starting to think about stochastic L-Systems. I'd like to add that sort of functionality.

As it stands now we have an LSystem class and a canvas that we draw to. It's all fairly small and straightforward.
